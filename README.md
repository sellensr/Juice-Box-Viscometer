# Juice-Box-Viscometer
A juice box can be converted to measure approximate viscosity of fluids.

https://youtu.be/TlGsKTeXFdE explains this frugal experiment to detect differences in viscosities between liquids. You can build the viscometer in any kitchen with just a juicebox and a pair of scissors. 

The analysis segment requires Jupyter Notebooks to run the Python code, probably most easily installed by downloading Anaconda. Download all the content to your own computer, then run the notebook there to be able to see the png image files in the notebook.

# Juice-Box-Viscometer
A juice box can be converted to measure approximate viscosity of fluids.

https://youtu.be/TlGsKTeXFdE explains this frugal experiment to detect differences in viscosities between liquids. You can build the viscometer in any kitchen with just a juicebox and a pair of scissors. 

The analysis segment requires Jupyter Notebooks to run the Python code, probably most easily installed by downloading Anaconda.

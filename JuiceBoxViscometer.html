<p>What forces are important in this fluid system? Where and how can you see their effects?</p>
<p>Try this experiment yourself with water and at least two other liquids. Take some photos of your juice box in action.</p>
<p>Estimate the viscosity of each liquid following the approach in the JuiceBox.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>Find tabulated values, or otherwise estimate the viscosity for each liquid from other sources.</p>
<p>How well did your juicebox let you estimate liquid viscosity?</p>
<p><strong>Produce a one page report answering this question, including a table of measured and tabulated viscosities from all your group members data, and photos of each of your juiceboxes.</strong></p>
<h2>The Sci Guys do a similar experiment, but without the control needed to actually quantify viscosity so we can use it for engineering applications</h2>
